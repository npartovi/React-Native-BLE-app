# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the Electric Dreams LED Controller app.

## Logo Setup

To use the Electric Dreams logo in the launch screen:

1. Copy the logo file to this directory:
   ```
   cp "/Users/nimapartovi/Desktop/electric dreams logo.png" "/Users/nimapartovi/Documents/ESP32LEDController/src/assets/electric-dreams-logo.png"
   ```

2. The LaunchScreen component is already set up to use the logo once it's in place.

3. Currently using a placeholder umbrella emoji until the actual logo is copied.
